# model-core

This library contains **all** the common DTO classes needed to connect registry microservices (Soap API, Rest API, Kafka API) between each other. It is expected to be extended by the Model component which is to be generated with `service-generation-utility`. The library is the basic dependency for the registry microservices.

# Deployment
The library is delivered as a docker image with all dependencies inside.
